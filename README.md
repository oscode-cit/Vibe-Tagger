## 📸 What is Vibe-Tagger?
Stop struggling with "caption block." **Vibe-Tagger** is a high-energy web application designed for social media creators. Unlike traditional tools that require you to type descriptions, Vibe-Tagger uses **Advanced Computer Vision** to "see" your photos.

It analyzes composition, lighting, and subjects to generate contextually relevant, viral-ready captions in seconds. Whether you want something *Savage*, *Professional*, or *Gen-Z*, Vibe-Tagger handles the creative heavy lifting for you.
